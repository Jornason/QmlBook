The Qt Creator IDE allows you to create various types of applications. If not
otherwise stated, we always use a Qt Quick UI project

A typical Qt Quick application is made out of a runtime as well as either native
plug-ins or native code which launches the runtime code. For the beginning we
will not cover the native side of development and focus only of the runtime
aspects of Qt5.


Example: HelloWorld

Qt Creator will create several files for you. The HelloWorld.qmlproject file is
the project file where the relevant project configuration is stored. This file
is managed by Qt Creator so donâ€™t edit.

Another file, HelloWorld.qml, is our application code.
